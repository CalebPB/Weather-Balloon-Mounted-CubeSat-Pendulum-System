# Balloon Payload Dynamics Simulation

## 📋 Overview
This repository contains the simulation framework for analyzing the dynamic behavior of a balloon-borne payload system during ascent. The system models a compound pendulum with aerodynamic forcing from wind profiles and altitude-dependent atmospheric conditions.

**Key Features:**
- Physics-based rigid body dynamics with aerodynamic forcing
- ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis data integration
- Parametric studies of design variables (mass, geometry, dimensions)
- Performance optimization through sensitivity analysis
- Publication-quality visualization tools

## 📊 Research Context
This code was developed for a System Dynamics research project in Mechanical Engineering, investigating the stabilization of payload systems during high-altitude balloon ascents. The study focuses on mitigating pendulum-like oscillations through aerodynamic and inertial design optimization.
